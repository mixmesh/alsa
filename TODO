* alsa_samples
 let mix / wave_mix mix directly from a number of sample buffers
 into a destination buffer (then extract the destination later)

* alsa_play

  prepend silence before each samples for T milliseconds
  let the normal beat be at T/2 milliseconds, using mark jump,
  then it is "easy" to move the sample start back and forth
  within one beat (changing jump length)
